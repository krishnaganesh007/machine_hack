## Problem Statement 

In today's financial landscape, an accurate prediction of customer loan default can reduce the risk and maintain a healthy lending portfolio. The challenge requires the participants to develop machine learning models to determine the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan. 

Contestants will be provided with credit history, payment behaviour, and account details to build the model. This challenge mirrors a huge real-world problem faced by financial institutions, thus making it extremely relevant.
